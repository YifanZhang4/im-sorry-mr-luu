  "Wow, can you believe it’s already the end of the semester? Doesn’t time just fly by? Do you feel old yet? I do. I can’t believe I’m almost eighteen. That sucks. I don’t want to be an adult. How do you deal with being an adult, Mr. Luu? It seems terrible. Taxes seem terrible. I can’t wait for next semester, when I get to see Scor torment you more. Thanks for the great last first semester of my time in highschool. You’re pretty cool, I don’t think I tell you that enough. I hope this was fun for you, or not. The goal was not to be fun.";
